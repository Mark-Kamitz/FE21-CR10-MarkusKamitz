# FE21-CR10-MarkusKamitz

### Project description:


**Task:** As a Full Stack Web Developer you got your first full-stack project, the Big Library web application. The customer wants you to create a big list of all media available in the library (books, CDs, DVDs) and make it available over the web.


**The information that you will need to have in your DataBase is:**

Consider them as columns for the table:

* title, image (HTTP link to an image*), ISBN code, short_description, type (book, CD, DVD), author_ first_name, author_last_name, publisher_ name, publisher_address, publish_date.

* Additionally, status (“available” or “reserved”)  required for Bonus Points.

* **Feel free to choose if you would like to use:**

* file uploader as in prework

* image name only and the images are already all available in a folder. You only need to make the reference in the DB.

* link from the internet as https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/09/10/17/18/book-1659717_1280.jpg


**Project Naming:**

Create a GitHub Repository named: FE21-CR10-Name. Push the files into it and send the link through the learning management system (LMS). Please make your repository private and collaborate with codefactorygit. See an example of a GitHub link below:

https://github.com/JohnDoe/repositoryname.git.

 

**For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded:**

* (20) Create a database and name it: fswd13_CR10_YourName_BigLibrary. The database must have the name as specified in this task! 

(Please note that YourName must be exchanged by your name)


**Only one table is required for this CodeReview!**

* (5) Add test data: at least 10 entries 

* (20) Display List of Media: Fetch the media data from your database and display it on the browser.

* (15) User-Friendly GUI: Create web-pages with a nice design using the Bootstrap framework or just HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

* (20) Insert form for Media: Create an inserting form for Media. A user should be able to insert data into the database over the front-end form.

* (10) Update form for Media: Create a form for updating Media.

* (10) Delete Media: A user should be able to delete Media from the database by clicking on the Delete button.

**Bonus Points:**

* (10) You should create a button - "show media", that will be displayed together with every Media shown on the list. Once that button is clicked, all details regarding that specific Media (title, author, ISBN, short_description, and status (available or reserved) will be displayed on a new web page.

(hint: take a closer look on the edit page, it may inspire you to do this task)

* (10) Create a list of Publishers. When you click on a Publisher name, a user should be able to see the list of Media that “belong” to this specific Publisher.
